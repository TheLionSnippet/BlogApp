My exploration of React.js by making a blog application and using-
->json server
->making use of different hooks as well as a custom hook for the app.

Inspired by DC Comics. You can make changes as per your preferences.

Dowload all dependencies.
It runs on json server so go to root folder and open two terminals for root folder directory-
In the first terminal use this command "npx json-server --watch database/db.json --port 8000"
This will activate the JSON server.
Now in the second terminal use npm start or npm run start
